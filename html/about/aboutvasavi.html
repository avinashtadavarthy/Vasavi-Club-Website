                <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>VASAVI MOVEMENT - A Brief Note</strong></h3>
                <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px;">A need was strongly felt to bring all Vysya Community to a common platform and to enable them to exchange their ideas
                and views and also to felicitate Arya Vysyas in those days who were qualified as IAS & as Doctor, Engineer & Advocates
                as well as those who visited Foreign Countries. With these modest aims and objectives the FIRST VASAVI CLUB was started
                in the year 1961 on 1st October with Eleven members at Hyderabad by Late Sri Kalvakuntla Chandrasena Gupta (K.C.Gupta),
                Freedom Fighter who could be regarded as not only the Founder but also as the "Father of Vasavi Movement".</p>
                <br><br>
                <h4><strong>Entering into the Field of Service :</strong></h4>
                <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px;">In the year 1971, one more era started in Vasavi Club by undertaking Service Projects like Pulse Polio, Educational
                Assistance, providing Sewing Machines & Wet Grinders to poor ladies for their livelihood. Later on, the activities of
                our movement had increased manifold to Fellowship, Leadership, Personality Development, Social Service and Educational
                Activities etc.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h4><strong>Extension :</strong></h4>
                <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px;">With a view to provide a common platform for all Vysyas nationwide, it was decided to extend Vasavi Clubs to other
                places. In the period between 1976 -92 about 6 clubs were extended. Vasavi Club Warangal was first extended club.
                Besides extension of New clubs, the co-ordination of the activities of all the Vasavi Clubs at various places was felt
                very much important. Then a Committee was formed in the year 1992 and the result was the formation of All India
                Association of Vasavi Clubs on 3rd. January, 1993.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h4><strong>From National to Vasavi Clubs International :</strong></h4>
                <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px;">When the Vasavi Movement has spread from National to International by extending Clubs in Overseas, in the year 2007 the
                name is changed from All India Association of Vasavi Clubs to International Association of Vasavi Clubs and in the year
                2008 it is again changed to VASAVI CLUBS INTERNATIONAL and registered at Hyderabad (Regd. No. 800/2008)</p>
                <br><br>
                <h4><strong>The growth of Vasavi clubs is illustrated herewith :</strong></h4>
                <div include-html="../components/about_table.html"></div>
                <br><br>
                <h4><strong>Total Clubs : 1,277</strong></h4>
                <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px;">Total clubs extended so far 1,277 out of which 457 clubs have been disaffiliated due to their non - functioning. The Net
                strength of the Clubs on rolls as on 31.12.2011 is 820. Today the Vasavi movement reached to 820 clubs with 19 clubs
                overseas, a remarkable achievement by all standards within a short span of a period of 19 years of extension.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h4><strong>ADMINISTRATION OF VASAVI CLUBS :</strong></h4>
                <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px;">Until the year 2000, the AIAVC was headed by the single Governor who was elected at the Annual Conference.
                As the Organisation grew in strength with about 92 clubs, a lot of planning had gone into the re-organisation of the
                Administrative mechanism by the formation of VASAVI DISTRICTS which came into operation from 01.04.2000. The National
                Governing Board was formed for managing the Administration of various Districts.The National body was headed by the
                National President elected at the National Convention. The National President nominates the National officers which
                constitutes the National Governing Board (NGB). With the Association becoming International, the organisation is headed
                by the INTERNATIONAL PRESIDENT elected at the Annual International Convention (ICON). The INTERNATIONAL PRESIDENT
                nominates the International Officers to assist in the day to day administration and monitor the activities of Districts
                and make policy decisions.
                To provide equal opportunity to Vysya Vanithas, First Vanitha Club was started at Vizianagaram in the year 2001-02. Now
                there are about 200 Vanitha Vasavi Clubs in VCI.</p>
